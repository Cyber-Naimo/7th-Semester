1 six sigma - 8  wastes

Talent:
talent ka waste ke bande ki skills ke mutabiq na use kia jaye

Inventory:
extra cheez lena jese certificate ya print waghera

Motion:
agar process me logon ko extra move karna hota hai jese 3 se char 4 chakar lagane parh rahe hai uper se neche matlab
human ko buhat chalna parh rha to ye waste of motion hai.

Waiting:
jese team ke bache assign karde review karne ke liye ke unko pata hai ke review time par nahi karke dega yani jo kaam
15 mint me hona hai usme ziada time lag raha

Transportation:
product or material ka waste yani ke jese environment ka setup har jaga alag karna ya jese apke pas ane se pehle kisi aur se 
guzar kar aye

Defect:
customer defect ke paise nahi deta

Overproduction:
user ko extra feature bana kar dena
ya jese sprint me 5 se ziada user stories bana kar dena jabke bola sirf 5 ka hi gaya ho

overprocessing / goldplatting:
feature zarorat se ziada acha bana kar dena



Fishbone Diagram from seven quality analysis tool by ishikawa for paper.

Risk: Risk is the probabilty of loss and gain bcz of factors not in our control.

Risk Exposure = impact into chance of occurence
R.E= P x L

risk can not be ended bcz of not in our control

we set owner, origin and domain to know that its project, product or management or bussiness risk.
than the occurence of risk like the risk of failing in exams are twice a year.

defect leakage: build ke duran kitne defects customer ne find kiye

we found 95 bugs and customer found 5 bugs 
so defect leakage is 5 percent.
the standard for defect leakage should not be greater than 5 %


create mind map of software testing

product owner: 
scrum master: 
developers: 

product backlog:
total list of requirements and other stuff

sprint backlog:
a chuck from the product backlog for a specific sprint

sprint should be less than one month

daily scrum of 15 minutes.

increment:
sum of usable sprint to the customer

review before increment.



retrospective review include only product manager, scrum master, developer also know as scrum team.

planning time should be 2 hour per week

review time should be 1 hour per weeek


big requirements are called epic are divided to feature further divided to user stories

epic -> feature -> user stories


Exploit = The good thing is already happening, so you jump on it to maximize the benefit.
Enhance = You’re trying to make the good thing happen by taking proactive steps.

Q1: A key team member is likely to leave the project mid-way, which could cause delays in completing critical tasks.
Your Answer: Negative | Mitigate | Train a separate programmer for this situation.
Correct Answer: ✔ Correct!
Risk Type: Negative (a delay is harmful).
Response Plan: Mitigate (by training another programmer, you reduce the impact of the team member leaving).
Q2: The software project may finish earlier than expected, which could allow the team to work on additional features.
Your Answer: Positive | Enhance | Work on other tasks.
Correct Answer: ✔ Partially Correct!
Risk Type: Positive (finishing early is beneficial).
Response Plan: Exploit instead of Enhance.
Exploit means taking full advantage of the situation (e.g., prioritizing important features).
Enhance is more about improving the likelihood of a positive event occurring, but in this case, the risk is already happening.
Q3: There is a chance of a power outage during a critical phase of deployment.
Your Answer: Negative | Mitigate | Create a backup power supply.
Correct Answer: ✔ Correct!
Risk Type: Negative (a power outage is harmful).
Response Plan: Mitigate (by implementing a backup power supply, you reduce the impact).
Q4: The project’s testing phase identifies an opportunity to improve the system's performance with a minor code tweak.
Your Answer: Positive | Enhance | Train or fix.
Correct Answer: ❌ Needs Revision!
Risk Type: Positive (improving performance is beneficial).
Response Plan: Exploit instead of Enhance.
Since this opportunity already exists, you should take full advantage of it (implement the code tweak).
Enhance would apply if you wanted to make it more likely to find such improvements.
Q5: A vendor delivering a critical system component may increase their charges unexpectedly, which could exceed the budget.
Your Answer: Negative | Avoid.
Correct Answer: ❌ Needs Revision!
Risk Type: Negative (budget overruns are harmful).
Response Plan: Transfer instead of Avoid.
You can transfer the financial risk by adding a penalty clause in the contract or negotiating fixed rates with the vendor.
Avoid means eliminating the risk entirely, which may not always be feasible here.
